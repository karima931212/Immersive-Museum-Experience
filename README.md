# Immersive Museum Experience
A 3D environment that can interact with different parts of the human’s body.
1. User needs to put a sensor on their head.
   * when they rotate their head, they can change the view.
2. There is a camera to detect the user’s facial expression.
   * when they blink eyes, they can take a photo.
   * when they open mouth, they can change colors of sculptures.
   * when they get close to the screen, they can hear the sound.
